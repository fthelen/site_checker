The goal of this project it to screen through a large volume of websites to determine one of the following states: 
    1) Active with content 
    2) Active for sale 
    3) Active with no content 
    4) Restricted 
    5) Inactive 
    6) Unreachable

This will require use of HTTP status codes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes), landing page information, and redirection data.

I intend to use several packages:
    1) pandas
    2) requests
    3) beautifulsoup

*This is my first project in python! Any advice is appreciated!*
